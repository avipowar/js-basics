## Understanding `this` in JavaScript

- How `this` works in the global scope
- How `this` behaves inside regular functions
- How `this` behaves inside nested regular functions
- How `this` works in arrow functions
- How `this` behaves inside objects and methods

- apply() → executes immediately with array arguments
- bind() → returns a new function with fixed this
- The main difference between call() and apply() is how arguments are passed
